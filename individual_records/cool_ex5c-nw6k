  "Description of Institution": "The genus Brassica, phylogenetically related to Arabidopsis thaliana, is one of economically important crops and a botanical model of plant polyploidization and rapid phenotypic evolution. We established the Brassica Resource Bank (BRB) in order to supply basic plant materials for structural/functional genomics and breeding of Brassica. BRB has served various Brassica species, especially, doubled haploid and recombinant inbred lines, and DNA stocks including BAC libraries and cDNA libraries. BRB has collected specific-Brassica cultivars as well as subspecies from international plant resource centers. Moreover, all germplasms of BRB have been propagated and maintained. Currently, BRB has collected 9,591 accessions for Brassica species, 91,446 clones for cDNA libraries, and 277,440 clones for BAC libraries, and 1,398 genetic markers. BRB has served more than 621,345 clones, 280 genetic markers and 6,210 lines to researchers in 10 countries since 2003. Information and other requests for genomic resources of Brassica are accessible at http://www.brassica-resource.org.",
