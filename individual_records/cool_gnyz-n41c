  "Description of Institution": "The mission of this unit is to develop ecologically and economically sustainable range animal management systems that meet consumers&#39; needs. Agriculture is the business of capturing solar energy and transferring it to humankind for their use (i.e., food and fiber), and grazing of rangelands is one of the most sustainable forms of agriculture known. Research focus is on developing profitable management tactics that enhance the efficiency whereby solar energy is captured by the forage resource and subsequently harvested and assimilated by grazing animals into highly desirable agricultural products.",
