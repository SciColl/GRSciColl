About 75% of the collections are vouchers from our plot networks, but we also have very extensive Bryophyte (~3000) and fern (~1000) collections. Our botanical collections (i.e., specifically collected as part of botanical collection activities) consist of about 1500 specimens. This includes marine specimens such as algae and sea grasses.",
