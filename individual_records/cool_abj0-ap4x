  "Description of Institution": "The Duke Lemur Center (DLC) living collection currently houses nearly 250 individuals across 18 species of strepsirrhine primates. Over its 50 year history, the DLC has housed, cared for, and made available for study over 4200 animals across 38 taxa including lemurs, lorises, galagos and tarsiers. Our living collection is available for on-site studies involving observation, interactive trials, and non-invasive manipulative techniques. Biological specimens are collected opportunistically (e.g., during routine physical exams and necropsies) and total more than 10,000 samples of various types (e.g., blood, serum, urine, hair, organ tissues, cadavers, etc.).  The public availability of corresponding datasets based on historic life history data and medical records allow studies using our living colony and biobank to employ a holistic approach.- large sample sizes, longitudinal data and samples that in many cases span an animal&rsquo;s entire life, exact dates of events, and large numbers of individuals from closely related yet biologically diverse primate taxa make the DLC resource unique. The scientific endeavors at the DLC span a remarkable array of disciplines, including aging, behavior, cognition, epigenetics, genomics, phylogeography, physiology and virology.",
