  "Description of Institution": "Entered Jul 2011.  The herbarium was established shortly after the founding of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL), in 1929 by Harriet G. Barclay from the University of Tulsa (TULS). It has served as a resource for plant identification and distribution information for students and researchers at the lab and contains vouchers from many research projects over the past 80 years. The collection is completely databased and searchable online at:; http://rmbl.org/herbarium/index1.html .; The laboratory/field station, located at over 9500 ft.in the Elk Mountains of Western Colorado, is open and accessible seasonally from May-October. The collection is curated by volunteers from other institutions who work at the lab each summer (currently C.F. Rick Williams, Curator, Ray J. Davis Herbarium [IDS], Idaho Museum of Natural History; and George Weiblen, Assistant Curator of Vascular Plants, Bell Museum of Natural History [MIN], University of Minnesota).",
