  "Description of Institution": "The Museum of Art and Archaeology holds archaeological collections with strengths in the eastern Mediterranean, including sites excavated by the University of Missouri expeditions including Tel Anafa and Jalame, as well as individual objects from a range of sites throughout the classical world.  The University also partners with the Capitoline Museum in Rome to study and document previously unstudied antiquities from Sala V of the Antiquarium in Rome.    The Museum of Art and Archaeology advances understanding of our artistic and cultural heritage through research, collection and interpretation. We help students, scholars and the broader community to experience authentic and significant art and artifacts firsthand and to place them in meaningful contexts. We further this mission by preserving, enhancing and providing access to the collections for the benefit of present and future generations.",
