  "Description of Institution": "The U.S. Botanic Garden maintains 10,423 accessions and 47,564 living individual plants. These are used for exhibition, study, and exchange with other institutions. The Garden&#39;s noteworthy collections include economic plants, medicinal plants, orchids, carnivorous plants, cacti and other succulents, bromeliads, cycads, and ferns. Historic specimens include several that date from the original 1842 founding of the collection.  The Garden also serves as a rescue center for plants confiscated at U.S. borders in cooperation with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  While individual plants are the building blocks of exhibits, the plant collection as a whole reflects our institutional history and priorities, and supports programmatic goals.",
