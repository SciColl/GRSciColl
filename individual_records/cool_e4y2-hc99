  "Description of Institution": "The Culture Collection includes approximately 3,000 different strains of living algae, representing most major algal taxa. The primary function of UTEX is to provide algal cultures at modest cost to a user community. Cultures in the Collection are used for research, teaching, biotechnology development, and various other projects throughout the world. Most of the strains are kept under a numerical order system that require no prefixes, but there are four collections that use the prefixes SP, EE, FD, and SNO.",
