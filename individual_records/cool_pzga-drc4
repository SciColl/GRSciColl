  "Description of Institution": "Updated Jan 2013 (address):   We are pleased to inform you that custom problems were solved by our Institution and therefore we can receive loans, safe and secure, at our traditional address. Also, we would like to comment that for the reception of packages of plants being sent to our Institution, as loans, return loans, exchanges and gifts, the Custom agents request that a phytosanitary certificate be mailed, according  to quarantine restrictions that here apply for herbarium material. So we would be grateful if a  copy of the phytosanitary certificate be sent, by email, prior to the shipment of the specimens. Finally, the shipment/s of botanical specimens should be sent by regular mail, i.e. not by private couriers (such as FedEx, DHL and so on).  SI contains more than 135 000 specimens, including 1000 types, 2400 periodicals, 8500 books, and the updated checklist of vascular plants can be viewed on the SI web page.",
