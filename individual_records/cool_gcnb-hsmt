  "Description of Institution": "Entered Feb 2013.  The Elizabeth Teter Lunn Herbarium is home to more than 5,000 plant specimens dating primarily from the turn of the twentieth century, with some being collected, purportedly, as early as 1848. Between the years 1895 and 1897. M.C. Jensen, a student and botanist, collected more than 80 specimens within the city of Lake Forest, IL, and added these to the College's collection.  At present, student Victoria Jones is in the process of writing a proposal for Lake Forest College to pay more attention to the collection and thus salvage this one-of-a-kind herbarium. This proposal reflects Victoria's senior-thesis topic and all of the tedious curatorial work she has committed to for the past three years. Victoria is currently working alongside Gerould Wilhelm, the foremost vascular plant botanist of the Chicago Region, to observe truth and beauty in each specimen of the ETL Herbarium. The outcome will be Gerould Wilhelm's & Laura Rericha's brand new book, Flora of the Chicago Region. This book will update Swink & Wilhelm's Plants of the Chicago Region (1994).",

  "Geographic coverage of herbarium": "The majority of the collection contains specimens from Illinois Beach State Park (IBSP) collected by Elizabeth Teter Lunn (professor at Lake Forest College) between the 1950s and mid-1970s. Lunn's interest in collecting from IBSP was based on an earlier study tallying the park's flora during the 1900s. The result was the publication of her guidebook, \"Plants of the Illinois Dunesland,\" completed in 1982 and published by The Illinois Dunesland Preservation Society.",
