  "Description of Institution": "Internationally-acclaimed scientists work in interdisciplinary research teams in chemistry, microbial ecology, invertebrate biology, watershed ecology, and ecosystem modeling to study the physical, chemical, and biological processes of streams and rivers, the life histories of individual organisms, and the ecology of watersheds. The Center's educational programs seek to disseminate the findings of the research projects, serve as a resource for science teachers, and enhance the stewardship of watersheds. Specimens are not cataloged with collection codes, but are divided into three groupings: 1.",

  "Date herbarium was founded": "Benthos. These are part of a study to evaluate the utility of using COI (BARCODE) to identify specimens from quantitative benthic macroinvertebrate samples. Many of these specimens are early instars and are not generally identifiable at the species level by traditional morphological characters. 2.",
