  "Description of Institution": "The mission of the Stored Product Insect and Engineering Research Unit is to develop economical, effective, and ecologically sound methods for managing insect pests of grain and processed commodities, improve post-harvest management practices, and develop methods to rapidly evaluate grain quality. Multi-disciplinary teams conduct research on insect monitoring and management tactics; use functional genomics to understand pest insect biology and develop targeted management tools; develop technologies and tactics to improve grain quality during storage and handling; and develop sensors and techniques to rapidly evaluate grain traits. Successful completion of the mission will contribute to ensuring the availability of high-quality grain and grain-based food products for the growing global population.",
