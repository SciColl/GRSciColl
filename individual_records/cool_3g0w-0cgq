  "Description of Institution": "The mission of the Molecular Plant Pathology Laboratory is to solve problems related to the management and control of agriculturally important plant diseases. The Laboratory&#39;s research program involves comprehensive studies of plant diseases caused by two major types of pathogens: 1) subcellular pathogens (viruses and viroids) and 2) prokaryotes (phytoplasmas, spiroplasmas and walled bacteria), and studies of plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. The research addresses the ecology, morphology, systematics, biochemistry, molecular biology, host/resistance, genetics, and genomics of the pathogens; host-pathogen interactions; and the development of new diagnostic approaches and safe disease control mechanisms. Our research addresses damaging diseases of crops including grape, apple, citrus, alfalfa, corn, sugar beet, and vegetable crops. Our scientific advances impact agricultural crops, forest and ornamental trees, natural ecosystems, and animal health.",
