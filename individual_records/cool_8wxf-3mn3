  "Description of Institution": "The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge houses two biological collections cataloging biodiversity of the western Kenai Peninsula.  The entomology collection (international collection coden: KNWR) currently includes over 7,000 databased specimens/lots, mostly insects collected as part of the Refuge&rsquo;s Long Term Ecological Monitoring Program.  The herbarium contains over 200 plant specimens, including many older specimens from the 1950s and 1960s.  Our collection data are managed on Arctos and are searchable via an entomology collection portal, an herbarium portal, and through GBIF.  Genetic data (DNA barcodes) from KNWR specimens are posted on BOLD and GenBank.  Loans of KNWR specimens for research purposes are encouraged.  Since most KNWR arthropod specimens are eventually to be deposited at the University of Alaska Museum, please refer to the UAM entomology collection loan policy for general loan guidelines.    The arthropod collection contains about 20,000 specimens focused on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. All of the arthropods (insects, spiders, centipedes, etc.) will be a single collection without the need for collection codes for the foreseeable future. There are also a handful of Gastropods and Oligochaetes included.",
