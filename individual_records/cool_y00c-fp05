  "Description of Institution": "KEMB is established microbial and genetic resource center for environmental industries. Recently the demand of the microorganism is increasing according to the activation of environmental-industry. Collection and conservation of native environmental microorganisms (from water, soil, marine) and genetic resources. Construction of systematic management system for effective conservation and application of microbiological resources for environmental industries Promotion of research and industrial activity by utilizing environmental microbial and genetic resources Accomplishment of ecological recovery through constructing ecofriendly bioremediation system substituting chemical treatments by supplying basic microbial resources. There are 10,336 strains in the bank, including photosynthetic bacteria, xenobiotics degrading bacteria, nutrition salts degrading marine bacteria, odor degrading bacteria, and isolated bacteria from environments, materials, animals and humans. All specimens are kept in a single collection with a single numbering system and require no collection codes.",
