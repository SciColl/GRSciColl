  "Description of Institution": "For nearly a century the Department of Anthropology at the University of Minnesota has prepared students in sociocultural anthropology, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistics. With 17 faculty members and about 60 graduate students, the department teaches over 2,200 undergraduate students each year.  The Evolutionary Anthropology Laboratory (EAL) is a research and teaching facility established in 1999 with funding from the National Science Foundation and the College of Liberal Arts at the Univeristy of Minnesota. Evolutionary Anthropology is the Study of the Human Condition - past and present - from the perspective of modern evolutionary theory. It is a multidisciplinary endeavor bringing together data and theoretical perspecitves from archaeology, paleoanthropology, physical anthropology, and primatology. The EAL holds a collection of over 500 primate skulls and skeletons from Africa and South America.  We aim always to provide the highest standards of curatorial care and to promote access to the collections by other scholars.",
