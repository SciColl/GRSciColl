  "Description of Institution": "The University of New Mexico Earth Science Collections includes a variety of paleobiological, rock, and mineral specimens. The paleobiology collection (UNMP) includes over 25,000 specimens, primarily of marine invertebrate and terrestrial plant fossils. The collection spans the entire Phanerozoic Eon and the geographic scope is global, with an emphasis on specimens from New Mexico and the surrounding region. Many of these regional specimens are not well represented in other academic or national museum collections. Flora and fauna from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous Periods are particularly well represented. The collection also includes more than 50 type specimens of Pennsylvanian and Early Cretaceous mollusks, and Pennsylvanian insects. Preservation of specimens is primarily as body or trace fossils. The petrologic and mineral collections consist of over 20,000 specimens spanning from the Proterozoic to Modern and containing notable specimens from the Southwest region and globally. These collections include unique petrologic collections from the Harding Pegmatite Mine, NM and Chuar Group from the Grand Canyon region. Preservation of specimens is primarily as hand samples, thin sections, and rock/mineral powders.",
