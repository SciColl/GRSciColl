  "Description of Institution": "Our research unit advances comprehensive knowledge of the biological and economic impacts of invasive pest/pathogen populations and develops appropriate sustainable, economical, and environmentally friendly management strategies. Research encompasses insects, weeds, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, and viruses, and focuses on the interactions of pests and pathogens with their hosts at the molecular, cellular, organismal and ecological levels. We also curate the world&rsquo;s largest collection of fungal pathogens of insects to provide fungal germplasm for research and biopesticide development. Research is regional, national and global in scope and we strive to develop outcomes that are directly transferable to our stakeholders. Current efforts support the following key commodities; potato, tomato, citrus, coffee, greenhouse and nursery crops, as well as, diverse natural landscapes with results being applicable to many other agricultural and natural ecosystems.",
