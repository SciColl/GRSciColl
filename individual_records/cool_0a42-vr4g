  "Description of Institution": "The NARO Genebank (former name was NIAS Genebank) is the central coordinating institute in Japan for conservation of plants, microorganisms, animals and DNA materials related to agriculture. The NARO Genebank coordinates this activity in collaboration with a network of institutes throughout Japan.  The NARO Genebank actively participates in collaborative activities with other countries in relation to surveys and research related to agricultural related genetic resources. In all activities related to conservation of genetic resources the NARO Genebank follows the international community norms and national regulations. Plant and microorganism germplasm within the NARO Genebank system collected in Japan is available for research purposes.  For scientists interested in germplasm related to agriculture within the NARO Genebank system they are directed to the databases that follow that provide full details of how to request materials in each category of genetic resource.  The databases of the NARO Genebank that can be found at this web site include information on passport data, evaluation as well as more general information on genetic resources.",
