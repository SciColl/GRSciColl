  "Description of Institution": "The activity of the AMIB (Arthropods of Medical Importance Bank) is to collect, cultivate, and systematically manage various kinds of arthropods and to supply them to the research institutes/companies. The Bank promotes a development of biomedicine, applied science and technology which are related with arthropods of medical importance. We provide a lot of study materials derived from arthropods of medical importance, including mite, cockroach, mosquito, and midges. Not only dried or immersed specimen of these samples but also crude extract and recombinant proteins of several species are now being provided to various research oriented facilities mostly in Korea. The AMIB has been established in the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine since 1999 to provide research materials and to procure information for the research scientists and industries.",
