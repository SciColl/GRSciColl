  "Description of Institution": "The University of Wisconsin Geology Museum (UWGM) is the most popular science outreach venue on the University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison campus. Each year the museum attracts about 40,000 visitors including over 14,000 school children who receive hour-long guided tours. It also functions as a teaching tool for many undergraduate courses in geology, zoology, history of science, and art. The UWGM has 4,200 square feet of display space, which contains exhibits on numerous aspects of geology, especially mineralogy and paleontology. To reach as wide an audience as possible, admission to the museum and to all museum-sponsored events is free.  \t   Other noteworthy holdings at the UWGM include:  \t\u25cfA premier collection of fossils from the Waukesha Lagerst&auml;tte, a deposit in Wisconsin that remarkably features the preservation of soft-bodied organisms; these fossils provide one of the best glimpses into what life was like during the Early Silurian Period (~ 428 to 436 million years ago)  \t\u25cf Dinosaurs and reptiles from the Jurassic Morrison Formation and Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation  \t\u25cf Fish, birds, and reptiles from the Cretaceous Niobrara Formation  \t\u25cf Paleogene mammals from the White River Badlands of South Dakota  \t\u25cf A lithostratigraphic collection of Paleozoic fossils from Wisconsin, including fossils illustrated in the Geology of Wisconsin, Survey of 1873-1879.",
