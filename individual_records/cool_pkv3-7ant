  "Description of Institution": "Scientific collection created in August 2012, containing mainly marine specimens, both, recent and fossil.    \tRecent specimens are mostly formalin fixed following preservation in ethanol. Some specimens have been always preserved in 95% ethanol so they are potentially suitable for genetic analysis.    \tCollection also includes: herborized algae and seagrasses, a frozen collection of bird blood, dry shells of molluscs and taxidermized mammals, fishes and birds.    \tMost specimens in the collection are from the SE Pacific, including also Chile&#39;s oceanic Islands. Bathymetric range of the specimens goes from the supratidal to 3000m depth.",
