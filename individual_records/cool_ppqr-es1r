  "Description of Institution": "The major collection of animal parasites in North America. It is one of the world's largest parasite collections and is the major repository of helminth type specimens for North American parasitologists. Although helminths are the largest group in the collection, other groups include parasitic protozoans, pentastomes, lice, mites, ticks, and other miscellaneous parasites. Many of the parasites were collected during USDA survey and eradication programs. About half of the specimens are stored in small bottles in a solution of 92 parts 70 percent ethanol, 3 parts formalin, and 5 parts glycerine. The others are mounted permanently on glass microscope slides. Specimens cataloged in a single collection without collection codes.",
