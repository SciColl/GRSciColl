  "Description of Institution": "The Polar Rock Repository (PRR) was established to curate and loan geologic samples from polar regions to researchers and educators. NSF-DPP established the PRR in part to avoid redundant sample collection and thus reduce the environmental impact of polar research. The PRR also provides the research community with an important resource for developing new research projects. The PRR acquires rock collections through donations from institutions and scientists and makes these samples available as no-cost loans for research, education and museum exhibits. Sample metadata is available in an on-line database. The database also includes rock property information useful for geophysical studies. Researchers may request samples for analysis using an online request form.",
