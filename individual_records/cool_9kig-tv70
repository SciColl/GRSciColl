  "Description of Institution": "The University of Washington Fish Collection is a state-supported facility that is part of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture located on the University of Washington campus in Seattle.  Fish Collection staff and resources play an important role in undergraduate and graduate education within the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and our school outreach program is very popular. We also provide a variety of tours for other interested parties, and field many telephone inquiries from the press and public concerning mysterious fishes and other ichthyological matters.  Our primary mission is to support teaching and research in the areas of ichthyology, fisheries biology, aquatic biology, conservation, and biodiversity, and to provide a source of ichthyological information for the public. We maintain a large archival collection of preserved fishes from the Pacific Northwest and around the world, and we make this valuable material available for study both to visitors in the collection and through a program of gifts, loans, and exchanges.",
