  "Description of Institution": "The Swedish Museum of Natural History is a major research institute that combines a venerable tradition with modern working methods. Our collections comprising almost ten millions of specimens, constitute an amazing archive of the natural world and our research laboratories are of world-class. The research staff at the museum collaborate with colleagues all over the world, and we receive many guest researchers every year. Collaboration in four fundamental reseach themes allow us to combine our specialist knowledge in different fields and obtain in this way increased understanding of the development and diversity of the Earth and the life on it. One of our specialties is systematics and phylogeny, i. e. research on the tree of life. Each year the recent past, the Research Division has participated in over 200 scientific publications, discovered over 100 new species and has welcomed over 500 visiting scientists from around the world.",
