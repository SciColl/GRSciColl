  "Description of Institution": "The mission of the Imported and Fire Ant and Household Insects Research Unit develops integrated management processes for imported fire ants and other invasive pest ants. Emphasis is on the development of novel, safer methods, and better strategies for controlling these invasive pests, with less reliance on traditional pesticides. Research supports many economic sectors, including the general public, agricultural and livestock producers, the pest control industry, medical practitioners, communication and electrical industries, as well as state and federal agencies, e.g. APHIS, EPA, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Interior. Areas of research include the development of functional genomic resources, classical biological control tools, bio-pesticides, chemical ecology, targeted baits, surveillance and monitoring tools, repellents, ecology and biodiversity, population dynamics, toxicology and molecular biology.",
