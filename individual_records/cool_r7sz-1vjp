  "Description of Institution": "The mission of the FSUCML is to conduct innovative, interdisciplinary research focused on the coastal and marine ecosystems of the Wider Caribbean that contribute to solving the ecological problems of the region by providing the scientific underpinnings for informed policy decisions. The Wider Caribbean includes the large marine ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the southeast U.S. Continental Shelf (thus covering both Florida coasts) &ndash; an area that is both enormously underserved and of high economic and geostrategic value.   Research is conducted by faculty, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate investigators from the FSUCML, from the main campus, and from other universities throughout the world.",
