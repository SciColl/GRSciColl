  "Description of Institution": "The UWI Zoology Museum contains approximately 70,000 specimens of preserved animals. They include representatives of all major groups with strengths in reptiles and amphibians, fish, insects, corals, crustaceans and molluscs, with smaller collections of mammals and birds. The majority of specimens are from Trinidad &amp; Tobago but there are many from the surrounding region. The core of the collection came from the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture established in the 1920s. This evolved into the University of the West Indies. Other local collections have been merged with the UWIZM, these include the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC), The Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI), and the zoological specimens from the National Museum of Trinidad &amp; Tobago (NMTT).   In many older publications the collection is known as the Land Arthropod Collection of the University of the West Indies.",
