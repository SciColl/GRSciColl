On exhibit are an impressive two-meter long Japanese spider crab, a spectacular skeleton of a Minke whale and the Abe Levine collection of shells which features such rarities as the small but valuable Golden Cowrie. Exhibits in the Dawson Gallery showcase the Biodiversity of Quebec, from the boreal forest to urban backyards, endangered mammal species, such as the lion, gorilla and wolf, extinct bird species such as the Passenger pigeon and invasive invertebrates such as Zebra mussels. Multiple collections (fish, birds, etc.) are cataloged separately and do not have collection codes.",
