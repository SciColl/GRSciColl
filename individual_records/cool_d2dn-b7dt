  "Description of Institution": "Our mission is to improve soybean, common bean, and wheat to provide sustainable solutions for consumers in America and around the world. We accomplish this by 1) developing molecular markers and genetic maps to define genes controlling seed quality, disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, and productivity; 2) discovering and elucidating the function of genes and molecular mechanisms governing traits such as disease resistance and seed quality; 3) maintaining the National Rhizobium Germplasm Resource Collection to support symbiotic nitrogen fixation applications and research; and 4) providing electron microscopy diagnostic and research support to collaborating scientists.",
