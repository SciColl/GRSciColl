  "Description of Institution": "Founded in 1982, the mission of the Nevada State Museum, Las Vegas is to inspire and educate a diverse public about the history and natural history of Nevada. The Museum collects, preserves, exhibits, and disseminates material that contributes to an understanding and appreciation of the state.  \t\tThe Nevada State Museum &amp; Historical Society opened to the public in November 1982. At the time of its completion, the building at 700 Twin Lakes Drive in Lorenzi Park was the largest structure of its kind in Nevada built expressly as a museum. The Museum in Lorenzi Park had three major galleries: Biological Sciences, Geological Sciences and History/Prehistory. The museum also included a changing exhibit gallery, various corridor exhibitions, a research library, and collection storage.  \t\tIn 2000, the Nevada voters approved an appropriation that included the construction of a new museum facility at the Springs Preserve and during the 2007 legislative session, the museum&rsquo;s name was officially changed to Nevada State Museum, Las Vegas. The construction of the new building was completed in the spring of 2009. Two years later, the 2011 legislature voted to approve the opening of the new museum. The new building, located 309 S. Valley View Blvd, opened to the public October 2011.  \t\tWith 70,000 square-feet of exhibit, library, collection storage, and public space, the new Nevada State Museum at the Springs Preserve is double the size of the former location at Lorenzi Park. The additional space allows for the display and interpretation of new artifacts such as paleontological fossils and new collections such as the 8,000 piece Folies Berg&egrave;re costume archive. Objects from the museum&rsquo;s collections that have never before been exhibited can now be seen on display at the state-of-the-art facility.  \t\tIn addition to our own mission, we are guided by the mission, vision, and philosophy, of the Division of Museums and History:  \t\t  \t\t\tMISSION  \t\tThe Division of Museums and History preserves, shares, and promotes the understanding, and celebration of Nevada&rsquo;s natural and cultural heritage for the enrichment of all generations.  \t\t  \t\t\tVISION  \t\tRecognized as the most trusted stewards and engaging storytellers of Nevada&rsquo;s heritage.  \t\t  \t\t\tPHILOSOPHY  \t\tWe will work as a team to build consensus and fulfill our vision, putting the public&rsquo;s needs first while adhering to the highest professional standards.",
