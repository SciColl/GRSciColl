  "Description of Institution": "Sagehen Creek Field Station is a research and teaching facility of the University of California at Berkeley. Established in 1951, the field station sits within the 9,000-acre Sagehen Experimental Forest.   Sagehen maintains teaching collections of plants, mammals, birds and insects. These collections began in the 1950&#39;s. While the animals are inactive, the herbarium is actively being expanded with additions from the Sagehen basin and the properties of the other Central Sierra Field Research Stations in the North Fork of the American River. Sagehen also engages volunteers to collect geo-referenced observations through iNaturalist to complement the physical collections.",
