  "Description of Institution": "Entered October 2012. ECWP herbarium is open to any researcher and amateur, by appointment, on request. However validation by the ECWP Operation Director is mandatory. The ECWP herbarium is located at ECWP headquarters in Missour, Morocco, in a building dedicated to botanical studies. Specimens are mounted on acid-free, archival paper (48 x 28 cm) and are stored in cardboard boxes, that are themselves in cabinets. Many vouchers have been verified by Mohammed Ibn Tattou (Institut Scientifique de Rabat), one of the authors of the Flore pratique du Maroc. There is an Excel file list of identified specimens vouchers. A software dedicated to sample collection management is planned for 2014. ECWP also has a botanical bibliographical collection, specializing in south-west Mediterranean flora and habitats, that includes 150 books and monographs and >4000 pdf files (books, monographs, papers). There is a flora/fauna database in the production for over three years, including over 1400 recent phytosociological relev\u00e9s.",
