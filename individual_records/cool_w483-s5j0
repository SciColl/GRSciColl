  "Description of Institution": "The Australian Tropical Herbarium (ATH) is a joint venture of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Director National Parks (DNP), Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM), Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation (DEEDI), and James Cook University (JCU). The ATH boasts state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure for specimen processing and curation, photography, pest and climate control, and field, herbarium and laboratory research. The main activity is management of the more than 160,000 plant specimens that comprise the CNS collection, a merger of the collections (and staff) of the Australian National Herbarium Atherton (QRS), the Queensland Herbarium Mareeba (MBA) and part of the JCU Herbarium collection (JCT) to form an unsurpassed representative collection of north Queensland's flora. Research at the Australian Tropical Herbarium covers a range of topics including tropical plant and fungal taxonomy and evolution, ethnobotany, ecology, climate change studies, development of identification products, agroforestry and regional ecosystem mapping. We currently have two numbering systems: one for DNA and one for all other collections (herbarium sheets, spirit, woodblocks). For non DNA specimens- CNS:12345 ; For DNA materials- CNS(DNA):12345 This will change once we revise the management of DNA materials; these will be databased according to the voucher specimen held in our main collection.",
