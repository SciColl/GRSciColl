  "Description of Institution": "The Pember Museum of Natural History and the Pember Nature Preserve provide programs, exhibits and activities for the people of eastern New York and western Vermont.  It is the only institution of its kind in the region and serves large numbers of school children each year.  The Museum and Preserve offer lectures, field trips, environmental studies, tours, hikes, day camps, outreach and many other special programs.  Franklin Tanner Pember, a member of the prestigious American Fern Society and an avid botanist, collected over 1000 specimens of plants found both locally and from around the continental United States. Iridescent butterflies from around the world in every shape, color and size make up the largest portion of the insect collection. Insects that mimic leaves and sticks and the large Rhinoceros and Hercules Beetles are among the many insects on display.  Mr. Pember collected sets of bird eggs and nests from around the United States to add to his collection from other individuals ranging from 1874-1920. While egg collecting is no longer fashionable or legal these eggs are an important historical resource for those studying bird biology.  Mr. Pember also collected sea shells and other examples of marine life. The majority of the collections are on exhibit in their original cases, while duplicate specimens are in storage.",
