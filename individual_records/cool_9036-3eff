  "Description of Institution": "The Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Norwegian: Norges milj&oslash;- og biovitenskapelige universitet, NMBU) is a public university with around 5100 students and 1700 employees. The main campus is located at &Aring;s in Akershus, Norway, and a smaller campus at Adamstuen in Oslo. Established in 1859 as the Norwegian Agricultural Postgraduate College, it became a scientific university college (vitenskapelig h&oslash;gskole) in 1897 and received university status in 2005. Prior to 2005 it was known as the Agricultural University of Norway (Norwegian: Norges landbruksh&oslash;gskole, NLH). Only a few years later, in 2014 the university merged with the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science (NVH) in Oslo, and is today known together as the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU). Having a history since 1859, it is the second oldest institution of higher education in Norway, after the University of Oslo. It is also the only educational institution in Norway to provide veterinary education.",
