  "Description of Institution": "The purpose of the bank is to develop and collect citrus genes, mutants and related materials that are essential for the research in breeding of citrus and other crops. Proper support systems including database will be established in the bank for maintenance and service of the collections (Maintenance and quality control systems for DNAs, Construction of database and update, Online/offline service systems, Collection of citrus mutants). We constructed EST library from the different citrus species and determined the EST sequences. From the analysis of gene, we found some abundant genes in the early stage of citrus fruit development. In addition, we also are collecting full-length cDNA and profiling the gene expression using the 3' and 5' RACE and DNA microarrays. The genes, materials and/or information are provided to anyone who researchers need for their research.",
