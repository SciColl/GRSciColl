  "Description of Institution": "The African Centre for DNA Barcoding (ACDB) is a division of the University of Johannesburg and an academic unit within the departments of Botany &amp; Plant Biotechnology and Zoology, and is subjected to the governance rules and structures of the Faculty of Science.  The mission of the African Centre for DNA Barcoding is to fill the knowledge gap and strengthen research frameworks for international, regional and inter-institutional co-operation in Africa, especially in the modern field of DNA technology for biodiversity science, such as DNA Barcoding.     ACDB has setup a DNA Bank focusing on plants:  1. Mission of the DNA Bank  Southern Africa has the richest temperate flora in the world with more than 24 000 taxa of 368 families, including more than 10% of the world&#39;s vascular plant flora on less than 2.5% of the earth&#39;s land surface area. Our Bank aims to preserve representative genetic information of the high diversity presented by southern African flora as a resource to be utilized in plant research by current and future generations.  2. Purpose of the Bank  Its main purpose is to enhance plant taxonomic and evolutionary studies by providing:    \t  \t\tPermanent storage of Plant DNA material  \t  \t\tDocumentation of each sample in a database online  \t  \t\tDNA aliquots. This is subjected to the recipient&#39;s compliance with the letter and spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).    3. Policies  Policies have been developed in line with the UN Convention for Biological Diversity. Samples will not be made available for bio-prospecting endeavors or any other commercial application.  4. Available taxa in the DNA Bank  The UJ DNA Bank currently contains over 12 000 samples either extracted (Doyle and Doyle, 1987) or as desiccated leaves in silica bags. Each sample is vouchered (JRAU or BNRH).",
