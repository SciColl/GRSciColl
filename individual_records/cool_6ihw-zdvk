  "Description of Institution": "Fundaci&oacute;n Otonga was established on 1998 to promote conservation of fauna and flora, specially endangered species. Land acquisition, reforestation, and participation of local communities are key activities to achieve these goals. Fundaci&oacute;n Otonga is one of the few successful examples of habitat conservation and community education and participation. At the moment, Fundaci&oacute;n Otonga owns four reserves, Reserva Otonga (3707 acres), Reserva Otongachi (377 acres), Reserva Otokiki (143 acre) and Reserva Otoyacu (247 acres).  \tCentro Jambatu de Investigaci&oacute;n y Conservaci&oacute;n de Anfibios is part of Fundaci&oacute;n Otonga. It is dedicated to amphibian research and conservation. It aims to implement the Ecuadorian strategic plan for amphibian research and conservation. It emphasizes the implementation of a modern Noah&#39;s Ark (scientists, conservationists, public and frogs on board) designed to mitigate and prevent the accelerated loss of frogs and toads. This Strategic plan was designed with the aim of catalyzing the conservation of threatened amphibians in Ecuador. Six programs (with numerous projects) were set in this plan: (1) research and monitoring of native amphibians, (2) strengthening of local capacities, (3) management and ex situ conservation of species at risk, (4) in situ conservation; (5) public education, and (6) bioinformatics and sharing of information.   \tCentro Jambatu holds collections of preserved specimens, tissues, and the most important alive amphibian collection of endangered Ecuadorian frogs.",
