The collection maintains around 400 strains of algae and cyanobacteria. In 2008, the facility moved to the Department of Biology at the University of Waterloo from its former location at University of Toronto, Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. Our strains are all accessioned under a single numbering system for the general collection and do not require collection codes. There is no government funding for this biorepository; fees are charged for all services, including the supply of cultures and culture medium.",
