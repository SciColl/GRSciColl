  "Description of Institution": "Federal-State plant/seed genebank located in Griffin, GA. The S-9 germplasm collection has grown to more than 90,000 accessions representing 257 genera and 1,553 taxa of 1,436 species. These accessions are maintained as a shield against genetic vulnerability (the inaccessibility of genes for host-plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses) and as potential solutions to the challenges to U.S. agriculture, particularly in the Southern Region (SR).We provide germplasm and data promptly, enabling their rapid mobilization in response to national emergencies or for long-range, high-risk research. Dissemination of information is through the Germplasm Resources Information Network (http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/)",
