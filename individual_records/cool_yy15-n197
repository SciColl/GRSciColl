  "Description of Institution": "The UCR Earth Sciences Museum houses a wide variety of material, including but not limited to: fossils, rocks, minerals, ores, and associated archival collections. We also have part of the Orcutt Shell Collections, which is scattered across several institutes. Please note that the acronym UCR has been used for our specimens and localities in the past, but is not unique (it is also used by the UCR Herbarium and by the University of Costa Rica). The code UCRC ESM should be used henceforth in order to prevent overlap with Costa Rica and with other UCR Riverside collections.",
