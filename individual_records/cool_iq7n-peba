  "Description of Institution": "The USGS Core Research Center (CRC) curates one of the country&#39;s largest collections of drillhole material.  The CRC houses cores representing more than 9,500 wells from 33 states, and cuttings from over 52,000 wells in 27 states. In addition, the CRC maintains over 25,000 thin sections created from the cataloged cores and cuttings and makes files containing chemical and physical analyses, performed by previous users of the collection, available for download.  The CRC receives up to 2,000 visits each year from researchers representing federal and state agencies, industry, and educational institutions in the U.S. and abroad. The CRC is located at the southwest side of Building 810, on the Denver Federal Center. Viewing of cores or cuttings is by appointment only.
