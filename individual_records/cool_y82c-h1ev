  "Description of Institution": "The Evolutionary Biology Unit (EBU) of the South Australian Museum (SAMA) maintains frozen and alcohol preserved tissues and DNA samples from approximately 120,000 vertebrate and invertebrate specimens. This collection, referred to as the Australian Biological Tissue Collection (ABTC), was the first such frozen tissue collection in any museum in Australia and one of the first two or three in the world. Today it is one of the largest wildlife tissue collections in the world. The collection encompasses most of the terrestrial vertebrate groups and a broad representation of major fish and invertebrate groups from Australia and surrounding regions. Each specimen receives a unique identifier and does not require a collection code. Alternate contact, inquiries for loans and accessibility: Dr. Terry Bertozzi Terry.Bertozzi@samuseum.sa.gov.au",
