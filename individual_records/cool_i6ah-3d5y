  "Description of Institution": "The mission of the SMML is to provide the knowledge required to identify and determine relationships about fungi of importance to agriculture and forests. Identification of plant pathogens is critical for assuring our biosecurity by preventing the entry of invasive fungi into the United States. Scientists study pathogenic fungi that can devastate agricultural crops and the environment as well as beneficial fungi that control insects and diseases thereby reducing the harmful environmental effects of chemical pesticides. The one-million reference specimens in the U.S. National Fungus Collections document the biological diversity and distribution of fungi through time and space. SMML provides on-line information including identification tools for plant-associated fungi to users through electronic databases on the Internet.",
