  "Description of Institution": "The Museum of Anthropology collections were created in 1885 when the University of Missouri began accepting gifts of ethnographic materials.  These items were organized into the Museum of Ethnology in 1902, and the name Museum of Anthropology was formally adopted in 1939.  The Museum is the only anthropology museum in Missouri and one of only a few in the Midwest.  The archaeological collection comprises artifacts dating from 9,000 BC to modern times, including the largest holding of prehistoric Missouri artifacts in the world.  Among the thousands of ethnographic objects the Museum curates is a sizable collection of historic Euroamerican materials as well as objects from many cultures around the world.  The Grayson Archery Collection is included in the Museum&rsquo;s special collections.  It is the largest and most comprehensive collection of archery equipment and archery-related objects in the world.  Additionally, the Museum holds the Fay Library of anthropological books and periodicals, the Sutton Collection of African weaponry, and archival materials relating to various collections.",
