  "Description of Institution": "The NSW Plant Pathology &amp; Mycology Herbarium, of the Biosecurity Collections, holds diseases of plants from Australia and overseas including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes. The collection houses many important specimens to both Australian agriculture and biosecurity and to scientific research. It is the largest of its kind in Australia, incredibly important to Australian industry, and the environment, and is irreplaceable.  The collection primarily holds plant diseases i.e. a pathogen that is injurious to plant health, plant products or plant beneficial organisms (such as diseases of plant beneficial insects or fungi). We also have non-pathogenic fungi (like mushrooms and lichen) and we are in fact the only recognised mycology (fungi) collection in NSW.  In addition to the preserved dried specimen we also maintain living cultures of plant pathogens and other fungi and bacteria, such as beneficial or commercially important species and strains. We have over 6,000 cultures, some dating as far back as the 1970s.",
