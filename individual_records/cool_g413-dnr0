  "Description of Institution": "Entered Aug 2011.  It was through the efforts of Dr. Gavino C. Trono Jr. that this marine plants herbarium was established in the early 1970's.  The Marine Science Institute (then the Marine Sciences Center) provided the seed money.  The late Dr. Velasquez donated all his algal collections to this herbarium, thus it carried his name in acknowledgment of his generous contribution. The seagrass collection of Dr. Miguel D. Fortes was later added to the herbarium. It was Dr. Edna G. Fortes who computerized the herbarium starting in 1987 with funds from the International Development Research Centre of Canada.",
