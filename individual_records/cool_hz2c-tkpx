  "Description of Institution": "The Natural History Division of the National Museum of Ireland cares for the Irish state collections in the disciplines of zoology and geology. The botanical collections of the Museum were transferred to the National Botanic Gardens, Dublin, in 1970.  The Natural History collections comprise approximately two million specimens. The largest of the collections, in terms of numbers, is the extensive insect collection, which accounts for approximately half of all specimens.  The collections date back to 1792 and include material from the museums of the Royal Dublin Society (1792-1877), Royal Irish Academy (1798-1890) and Museum of Irish Industry (1845-1867).",
