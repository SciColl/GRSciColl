  "Description of Institution": "A repository for maize mutants and other genetic stocks utilized by scientists conducting basic and applied biological research. Part of the USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System. Genetic Stocks ZEa. Genetic Stocks in our collection are listed in MaizeGDB.org. An on-line catalog and other search tools are available at: http://maizegdb.org/stock.php. Stock IDs for our collection are assigned based primarily on their physical location in our seed storage rooms. These are the Stock IDs listed in MaizeGDB and used for stock requests from us (https://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/request/). Our Stocks are also listed in the NPGS GRIN database (http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/searchgrin.html). IDs for our stocks in GRIN are based upon the unique database ID number generated when a stock is entered into MaizeGDB, prefaced by 'MGS '.",
