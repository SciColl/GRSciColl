  "Description of Institution": "The mission of Wheat, Peanut and Other Field Crops Research is to 1) develop cereal crop germplasm with inherent protection against insects and environmental growth stresses by using genetic techniques; 2) define biological and cultural control methods, life histories, genetics, biochemical interactions, and economic importance and develop improved agroecosystem management systems; 3) develop basic peanut germplasm for use in breeding programs to improve peanut cultivars in Southwest peanut-growing areas, with emphasis on host resistance to disease, environmental stress, and nutritional qualities; and 4) develop basic knowledge of mechanisms that convey resistance in peanut to diseases and environmental stress.",
