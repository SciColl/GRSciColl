  "Description of Institution": "Bovine Genome Resources Bank (BGRB), one of the Korean National Research Resources Banks, is established to collect and maintain a variety of precious genetic and informative resources for bovine genome research. The constructed BGRB has genomic library, DNA samples from many cattle individuals, and eventually a well-organized computer-assisted database. BGRB will have positive contribution in scientific and economic field through collection and reservation of genome resources, support for the others researchers and provision of the useful tools to identify the genes with economically important traits for the improvement of the cattle production in the future. BGRB has a single collection that does not require collection codes.",
