The collections originated in 1888 with the Geological Survey of Texas. The Texas Vertebrate Paleontology Collections have grown over the years to include collections from The University of Texas Geology Department, the Bureau of Economic Geology, Texas Memorial Museum (from which our historic collections acronym derived), Texas A&amp;M, Texas A&amp;M Kingsville, East Texas State University, Midwestern University, and Lamar University. Fossils from Big Bend National Park and Guadalupe Mountains National Park are among the federal collections held in trust. The Texas Vertebrate Paleontology Collections are part of the new Jackson School Museum of Earth Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin and can be found in the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory building on the J.J. Pickle Research Campus.",
