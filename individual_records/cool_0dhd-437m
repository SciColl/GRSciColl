The Luis Diego Gomez Herbarium is located at the Las Cruces Biological Station (8\u00b0 47' 7'' N, 82\u00b0 57' 32'' W), one of three field stations owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS; www.ots.cr) in Costa Rica.  This is a young herbarium (inaugurated 2006) but a comprehensive collection of the regional flora of southern Costa Rica is well underway, and all specimens are scanned and uploaded to the OTS plant database website (www.ots.cr/plantdatabase). The collecting is only ~1,400 km2 but spans an elevational gradient of 300 - 3200 m and a rainfall range from 1.5 - 5 m (see website for a map of collecting range).",
