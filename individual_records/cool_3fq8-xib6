  "Description of Institution": "The NZG Biobank acts as an integrated resource linking the multiple tissue collections (Tissue bank; DNA bank; Necropsy sample bank; Cell culture bank; Sperm bank) and provides samples and information to an interdisciplinary wildlife research and management audience regionally and globally.  Sample providers include national and provincial parks, wildlife ranches and zoological institutions, while users include HEI&rsquo;s, research institutions, wildlife owners and others.   Through the Biobank, a single port of entry for organisations requiring African wildlife biomaterials for research, biodiversity conservation and biotechnology development purposes has been established. An advisory committee oversees operational efficiency and strategy. Members represented on the committee are experts drawn from the stakeholder community, biomaterial sample providers, sample users, academics, national and provincial regulatory authorities.   The NZG Biobank is housed in a dedicated building with offices, fully equipped laboratories for processing and cryo-preservation, storerooms, and multiple rooms with fridges, freezers ranging from 4 degrees C to minus 150 degrees C, to ultralow (liquid nitrogen) temperatures.  The Bank coordinates, collects, processes and stores different tissue types such as extracted DNA, ear-notches, hair, feathers, semen, organs etc. and maintains the samples under different and optimal storage conditions that are suitable for future research and management applications.",
