  "Description of Institution": "Founded by Carl Haussknecht (1838\u20131903) in Weimar in 1896, the Herbarium Haussknecht was initially a private institution comprising the vast collections brought together by its founder in a separate building. After Haussknecht\u2019s death in 1903 and execution of a foundation from his estate, the collections were maintained and increased by Joseph Bornm\u00fcller (1862\u20131948). After World War II, the collections were moved to Jena and were affiliated to the Institute of Systematic Botany of the Friedrich Schiller University, to which they officially belonged since the 1920s. Actually, the Herbarium Haussknecht houses about 3.5 Million herbarium specimens, being one of the major European herbaria. Carl Haussknecht started plant collecting not earlier than in the mid-1850s. Compared with the size of the entire collection, there is a rather low number of older material at JE. Such historical collections include for example the herbaria of Christian Ehrenfried Weigel (1748\u20131831) and Johann Friedrich Glaser (1707\u20131789), which are kept separately. Other collections containing large amounts of old material are the herbaria of Charles Gaillardot (1814\u20131883) and Wilhelm Gerhard (1780\u20131858), both acquired by Haussknecht, and those of Alwin Georges (1823\u20131893) and Thilo Irmisch (1816\u20131879). Besides the widely distributed exsiccata, like those of Friedrich Metz (1819\u20131885) and Franz Sieber (1789\u20131844), these collections include even rarer material, for example specimens collected by Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein (1768\u20131826), Anton Rochel (1770\u20131847), and Johan Peter Rottler (1749\u20131836).",
