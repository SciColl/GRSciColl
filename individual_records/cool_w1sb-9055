  "Description of Institution": "On September 12, 1960, the US Forest Service&#39;s brand-new Northern Forest Fire Laboratory was dedicated in Missoula, MT. Now known throughout the community simply as the &quot;Fire Lab&quot;, its mission was&mdash;and is&mdash;to improve scientific understanding of wildland fire so it can be  managed more safely and effectively in the field. As part of the Fire, Fuel and Smoke Science Program at the Rocky Mountain Research Station, the Fire Lab has a wide variety of unique facilities and equipment that enhance the program&#39;s research efforts.     \t     \tThe first scientists to work at the lab performed research that today continues to be used, refined, and extended. The Fire Lab is equipped with state-of-the-art burn chambers, comprehensive laboratory facilities, extensive computing resources, and novel field instrumentation which provide a unique environment to conduct innovative wildland fire research. A description of the unique facilities and can be found at http://firelab.org/facility-resources.     \t     \tThe wind tunnel/combustion chamber (WTCL) facility is the only one of its kind in the world and is used to conduct experiments into wildland fire behavior, atmospheric chemistry, soil heating, fundamental fire physics, and wildland fire retardant effectiveness.",
