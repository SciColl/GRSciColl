  "Description of Institution": "NCGR Corvallis is a national genebank for invaluable clonal plant resources. The objectives of the unit are to collect, maintain, distribute, evaluate, and document global genetic resources of hazelnuts, strawberries, hops, mint, pears, currants, gooseberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, lingonberries and their crop wild relatives. Besides the strong primary service component of plant conservation and distribution, the research effort adheres closely to the practical problems of germplasm storage, maintenance, tissue culture, virus and disease testing and elimination, identity verification, molecular and morphological germplasm evaluation, and seed and clonal propagation techniques to increase knowledge based on scientific processes and principles. This genebank preserves diverse living plant collections for all people for all time.",
