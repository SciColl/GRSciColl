  "Description of Institution": "There was a time when the Transylvanian naturalism, as well as the European one, experienced a spectacular grow and by that time the Transylvanian Society for Natural Sciences (Siebenbarghische Verein far Naturwissenschaften zu Hermannstadt) was established (1849) as the result of German-Saxon intellectuals' initiative. They aimed for an organization fit to accommodate the sharing of their passion for the nature and to serve the dissemination of their discoveries in order to educate the younger generation in the spirit of knowledge about nature and of the preservation of natural trust.",
