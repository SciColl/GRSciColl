  "Description of Institution": "Inspiring Curiosity through Exploration  With historical roots dating back to the early 1800&rsquo;s, the Buffalo Museum of Science has had an eventful and rich journey into the present era of scientific exploration, research, and discovery. Our research collections are the records of this journey as they house artifacts and specimens that date back to our very beginnings and that span 5 different divisions of scientific study &ndash; Anthropology, Botany, Geology, Invertebrate Zoology, and Vertebrate Zoology. Through the years, we&rsquo;ve seen our collections grow from just a handful of artifacts and natural specimens to now over 700,000, with the majority of these specimens being of local provenance. While we are considered a smaller institution on a national level, we proudly hold the most extensive cultural and natural record in the world of the Greater Niagara Region, and we continually strive to offer the members of our local community and to the scientific community at large access to these natural resources. Overall, we seek not only to &ldquo;Inspire Curiosity through Exploration&rdquo;, but also to impart a greater understanding of the natural world to the general public.",
