Course participants discover, curate, examine, and publish new species, particularly invertebrate animals. Taxonomic papers resulting from this work are published within the Taxon Expeditions collection of the Biodiversity Data Journal. When permitted by the authorities of the field sites, samples are stored in the Taxon Expeditions collection, based in Leiden, the Netherlands. The Taxon Expeditions collection is also listed in The Insect and Spider Collections of the World.",
