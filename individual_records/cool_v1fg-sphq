  "Description of Institution": "Rooted in Chicago, Illinois, the Chicago Academy of Sciences was founded in 1857 and was the first science museum in Chicago. Through its most recent venue -- the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Lincoln Park -- the Academy connects its community to local environments and inspires life-long relationships with urban nature.  The museum collections and archives contain natural history collections in the disciplines of botany, entomology, geology, herpetology, malacology, mammalogy, oology, ornithology, and paleontology, as well as cultural collections, audiovisual collections, and archives. These materials range from the 1830s to the present and are predominantly from North America with a focus in the Midwest/Western Great Lakes region.",
