Hasbrouck Insect Collection contains approximately 850,000 insect specimens; representing at least 25 orders, 390 families, 4,000 genera, 12,000 species and 1,240 subspecies. Most specimens are from the southwestern United States; however considerable representative material is also available from other North American regions and Mexico. The collection was largely developed through the activities of past faculty - Drs. Frank Hasbrouck, Gordon Castle and Mont Cazier - and their students. An extensive reprint collection is available to visiting researchers. For further information and to arrange a visit or loan, please contact Curator Dr. Nico Franz (nico.franz[at]asu.edu) or Collection Manager Dr. Sangmi Lee (slee281[at]asu.edu).",
