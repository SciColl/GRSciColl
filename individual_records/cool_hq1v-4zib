  "Description of Institution": "Center for Fungal Genetic Resources (CFGR) was established to collect, maintain, and distribute genetic resources from plant pathogenic fungi for fungal genetics community and educational and research organizations in general. A total of 35,000 isolates including 25,000 T-DNA transformants of rice blast fungus and anthracnose fungus have been deposited in the center to date. In addition to the biological materials, related information regarding genotype and genetic diversity is available for subscribers (e.g. such as ITS region sequence, SSR, Restriction fragment length polymorphism, and Amplified fragment length polymorphism). Genetic resources in the center will serve for researchers in understanding genetic diversity and structure of fungal populations as well as in characterizing the genetic mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity. These materials also can be applied in development of fungicides or disease-resistant cultivars and in preparation of quarantine standards.",
