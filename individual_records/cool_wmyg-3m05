  "Description of Institution": "The Children's Hospital at Westmead's Tumor Bank is an invaluable resource for medical researchers from around the world studying childhood cancer. Samples of cancerous tumors are taken from consenting patients and placed into long term storage where they are then made available for research purposes. The ultimate aim is to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment for children with cancer. Collection includes solid tumours specimens, whole blood, bone marrow (both whole and dried onto slides), serial leukaemia specimens as well as cerebral spinal fluid and plasma samples. Tissue samples are transferred to cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00c2\u00b0C. All specimens are cataloged in a single numbering system and do not require collection codes.",
