  "Description of Institution": "The University of Hawai&#39;i Insect Museum serves as a center for insect identification and systematics-based research. We have workspace, equipment, and resources for detailed taxonomic analysis, and researchers from many different laboratories are able to work and interact under its auspices. Our close association with the extensive collections and staff of the Bishop Museum greatly enhances this interactive museum community.  The University of Hawaii Insect Museum is currently in the midst of digitizing the entire collection, which will result in a fully searchable database that includes images and can generate interactive maps. Some records can already be accessed at the Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network portal and at InvertNet. For an older database that may still be useful, search our Insect Holdings Database.    \tAreas of strength  Conservation  We house extensive native insect collections, including the Hawaiian Drosophila collection, which serve as historical records. Older collection records help establish patterns of decline and disappearance for different insect species, and may help to identify those factors which have led to the declines.  Agriculture  We house synoptic pest collections for most crops of agricultural importance including historical collections indicating the presence, absence and patterns of invasions for newly introduced insects. This part of the collection is invaluable for tracking the spread of new invasive insects and the effectiveness of control efforts for current and historical invasions.",
