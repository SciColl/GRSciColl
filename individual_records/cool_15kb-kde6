  "Description of Institution": "Te Papa's entomology team has an active research programme that includes describing new species, updating previous taxonomic treatments of particular spider groups, aquatic beetles and parasitic insects, as well as studying the geographical and phylogenetic relationships of parasitic insects with their hosts. Te Papa holds the principal collections of several entomological collectors: C. Fenwick (moths and flies); W.G. Howes (moths); G.V. Hudson (mainly moths, butterflies and beetles, but also other groups); J.H. Lewis (moths and beetles); A.C. O'Connor (beetles); J.T. Salmon (moths, stick-insects and springtails); H.W. Simmonds (Pacific Islands insects); M.N. Watt (leaf-mining insects); F. Chambers (wasps); T.H. Davies (Hawke's Bay insects and foreign butterflies); K.J. Fox (moths); and M.J. Meads (wetas and beetles).",
