  "Description of Institution": "Johnson State College* believes in the power of a liberal arts education to transform lives. We express this belief by providing high-impact, interdisciplinary learning experiences that cross academic and experiential boundaries; by creating opportunities for students to extend their classroom learning to the field, the laboratory, the studio, the community and the local and wider world; by recognizing and supporting the diverse starting points, backgrounds and goals of students; and by sustaining high standards, active participation, vigorous debate and mutual respect.  The Johnson State College Collection represents decades of work by faculty and students in sampling the biodiversity of the region. While the collection includes a range of specimens including mammal skulls and bird skins, the bulk is made up of invertabrates.   *Johnston State College will become Northern Vermont University - Johnson effective July 1, 2018.",
