  "Description of Institution": "The acronym ZIHU to refer to the invertebrate collection at the former Zoological Institute, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, began to be used since 1985, while the same acronym exists that stands for Zoological Institute, Hiroshima University, Higashi-hiroshima. The former institute was founded in 1930, the latter in 1929, and thus the precedence of the acronym ZIHU should be placed on the latter. The former is now known as the Invertebrate Collection of the Hokkaido University Museum with the acronym ICHUM.",
