  "Description of Institution": "The U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) is collaborative effort to safeguard the genetic diversity of agriculturally important plants. The NPGS is managed by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the in-house research agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Funding for the NPGS comes primarily through appropriations from the U.S. Congress. However, the NPGS is a partnership between the public and private sectors. Many NPGS genebanks are located at state land-grant university sites, which contribute lab, office, greenhouse and field space for operations, as well as staff for technical and support services. The private sector is a major user of the NPGS collections and is the primary means by which new and improved plants are commercialized.The mission of the NPGS is to support agricultural production by: acquiring crop germplasm; conserving crop germplasm; evaluating and characterizing crop germplasm; documenting crop germplasm ;distributing crop germplasm. The Database Management Unit (DBMU) develops and operates the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN). This database maintains electronic information on more than 570,000 unique accessions at twenty NPGS locations. Genebank staff use GRIN to manage the collections. Detailed information about NPGS accessions is also displayed in a public website that includes the capability for scientists to request material.",
