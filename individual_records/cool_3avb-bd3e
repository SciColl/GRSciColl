  "Description of Institution": "Our mission is to explore, describe, and preserve representative specimens of Earth\u2019s remarkable diversity of insects and to make these specimens available to the global community for research and education.  Contributions to the collection began in 1879 with specimens of insects and spiders from the North Shore of Lake Superior. During the last 135 years, the collection\u2019s holdings have grown from a regional collection of 3,000 specimens to a major national and international resource of more than 3.8 million specimens. The collection is the mainstay of graduate training in systematic entomology at the University of Minnesota.",
