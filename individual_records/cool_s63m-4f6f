Its climate-controlled storage facilities hold more than two million specimens, including several type series. Electronic files are in use since 1981. The in-house database system, Zootron V, currently manages more than 900.000 data records of the fauna collections. Like every other zoological research facility, the Museum of Zoology of the University of Navarra is open to world taxonomists wishing to consult its holdings. The Museum is a Data Provider for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and is an Affiliate to the International Comission of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The Museum is also in charge of the curation and management of the Natural History Collections of the School of Science.",
