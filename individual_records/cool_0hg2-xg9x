  "Description of Institution": "The collection complies with the UN directive on biological diversity as ratified by 150/161 member states (Cartagena protocol; ratified by Greece 24/05/2000).  Aims of the collection are: (a) To preserve and sustain human pathogenic fungi in a metabolic attenuated condition in order to safeguard biodiversity and promote taxonomic, physiological molecular, proteomic and metabolomic studies at a local and international level; (b) promote exchange of strains with other Culture Collections, educational and research institutions; (c) provide locally consultative service for accurate characterization of clinical fungi; (d) organize educational events, such as workshops small group tutorials, for health professionals, veterinarians, scientists and clinical scientists at a national and international level.    Mission: To sustain and increase resources and infrastructure for the ex-situ preservation of fungi, advance and promote the sciences relevant to fungal pathobiology and virulence through education, advocacy, and scholarly exchange of scientific information.  Services: All provided services and a catalogue of phenotypically and molecularly identified clinical filamentous fungi and yeasts, available for research and educational purposes, are published in the WDCM site (http://www.wfcc.info/ccinfo/index.php/collection/by_id/929 ). All requests for stains are accompanied by singing MTA agreement, available in English, as recently approved by the Legal Department of the Athens University.  Expertise:  As conveyed by the publication records (Scopus and PubMed). Briefly, taxonomy, pathobiology, immunology, pharmacology, infectious diseases fungal metabolites with biological activity.  Other:    \t  \t\t(http://www.isham.org):  coordination of global working groups on fungal epidemiology, organization of educational events in Mycology.  \t  \t\tThe Collection is a European training site for public health Microbiology (EUPHEM), The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).",
