  "Description of Institution": "The Ocean Genome Legacy Center of New England Biolabs is a non-profit marine genome repository within Northeastern University. The mission of OGL is to collect, describe, and preserve genomes from marine species, and to make these materials widely available for scientific research. OGL archives three separate types of material (genomic DNA, tissue samples, and whole specimens), but each has an ID within a different series unique prefixed numbers. Collection codes are therefore not necessary, as OGL:E00001 is distinct as is from OGL:S00001.",
