  "Description of Institution": "The Canadian National Collection (CNC) of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes is considered one of the best collections of its kind in the world in terms of size, species representation, and level of curation. It is maintained and developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada as part of its systematics research program, and is housed in the K.W. Neatby Building in Ottawa. The collection is estimated to contain approximately 16 million specimens systematically arranged in 1400 steel cabinets. Specimens are stored mostly as dry-mounted pinned specimens, but certain groups (e.g. larvae, aquatic insects, spiders, mites, aphids, midges, fleas, etc) are stored in liquid preservative or mounted on slides. The majority of specimens are from localities throughout Canada and North America, but significant holdings are present from other biogeographic regions.",
