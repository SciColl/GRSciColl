  "Description of Institution": "The UAMH Centre for Global Microfungal Biodiversity is a premier repository of biomedically and environmentally important fungi and bacteria, including emerging pathogens, opportunists, allergenic and toxigenic species. The research biobank comprises nearly 12,000 living biospecimens representing over 3,200 species. It is the largest and most important research archive of public health-relevant microfungi in the western hemisphere and one of only two top-level biobanks of these organisms in the world. The majority of the strains are uniquely held in UAMH and not replicated elsewhere. The UAMH microbial biobank is affiliated with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.  Significant collections include:    \t  \t\tFungi associated with human and animal disease including pathogenic, opportunistic, allergenic and toxic fungi.    \t  \t\tPlant root associated endophytes and mycorrhizal symbionts of woody, ericaceous and orchidaceous plants especially from boreal habitats.  \t  \t\tEnvironmental fungi causing stain and decay or problems in the built environment.  \t  \t\tInsect associated fungi including large collections of Ophiostomatales associated with mountain pine and other bark beetles.  \t  \t\tSignificant collections of fungi belonging to the Onygenales, Eurotiales, Microascales, Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota).  \t  \t\tFungi used for standardized testing procedures including biodegradation resistance and drug susceptibility.",
